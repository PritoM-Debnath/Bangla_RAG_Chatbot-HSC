# Bangla_RAG_Chatbot-HSC
This project is a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) conversational AI system designed to assist Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) students in Bangladesh. The primary objective is to provide a knowledge retrieval solution that offers short, precise, and factually accurate answers to questions related to the specific Bangla novel "অপরিচিতা."

The system operates by leveraging a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) and a vector database. It is pre-ingested with the full text of the novel, creating a semantically searchable knowledge base. When a user submits a query via the Telegram chatbot interface, the system performs a semantic search to retrieve the most relevant text segments. The LLM then synthesizes these retrieved segments to formulate a concise and contextually sound response, thereby enhancing learning outcomes by providing direct, on-demand academic support.
